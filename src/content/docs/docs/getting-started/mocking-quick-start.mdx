description: Launch Inspectr mocking in your browser or via the CLI
---

Inspectr lets you spin up a mock server from any OpenAPI file in seconds. Choose one of the options below to get started.

## Option 1: Launch in the Browser

Open the URL https://inspectr.dev/launch which a reference to a remote OpenAPI document:

```
https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/hello.openapi.yaml
```

Replace the `openapi` parameter with the URL of your own OpenAPI file. Inspectr will start immediately with mocking enabled.

You can easily mock the typical OpenAPI example APIs using Inspectr, by clicking the launch link:

- [Museum API](https://redocly.com/demo/openapi/museum-api) by [Redocly](https://redocly.com/)

  Click here [Launch Museum API](https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/museum.openapi.yaml) or visit https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/museum.openapi.yaml

- [Train Travel API](https://bump.sh/bump-examples/doc/train-travel-api/) by [Bump.sh](https://bump.sh/)

  Click here [Train Travel API](https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/train-travel-api-openapi-source.yaml) or visit https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/train-travel-api-openapi-source.yaml

- [Galaxy API](https://galaxy.scalar.com/) by [Scalar](https://scalar.com/)

  Click here [Galaxy API](https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/galaxy.openapi.yaml) or visit https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/galaxy.openapi.yaml


## Option 2: Start from the CLI

Run Inspectr locally and point it to the same OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npx @inspectr/inspectr --mock-backend=https://inspectr.dev/demo/hello.openapi.yaml
```

The proxy listens on port `8080` and the UI is available at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004).
