title: Mocking Quick Start
description: Launch Inspectr mocking in your browser or via the CLI
---

Inspectr lets you spin up a mock server from any OpenAPI file in seconds. Choose one of the options below to get started.

## Option 1: Launch in the Browser

Open the URL https://inspectr.dev/launch which a reference to a remote OpenAPI document:

```
https://inspectr.dev/launch?openapi=https://inspectr.dev/demo/hello.openapi.yaml
```

Replace the `openapi` parameter with the URL of your own OpenAPI file. Inspectr will start immediately with mocking enabled.

## Option 2: Start from the CLI

Run Inspectr locally and point it to the same OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npx @inspectr/inspectr --mock-backend=https://inspectr.dev/demo/hello.openapi.yaml
```

The proxy listens on port `8080` and the UI is available at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004).
