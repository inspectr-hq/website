[//]: # (# Upgrade Inspectr)

Upgrading **Inspectr** is usually a one-liner. Choose the method you originally used to install/run Inspectr.

| Method you use | How upgrades work                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| npx            | Always runs the latest version                           |
| Homebrew       | `brew upgrade inspectr`                                  |
| npm            | `npm update -g @inspectr/inspectr`                       |
| Binary         | Download a newer release and replace the existing binary |
| Docker         | Pull the newest image and restart the container          |

## Upgrade when you run with npx

If you run Inspectr via `npx`, you don’t need to upgrade. Every run downloads and executes the latest published version:

```bash
npx @inspectr/inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

If you want to ensure you’re not using a cached copy, clear the npx cache (optional) and run again.

## Upgrade a full installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

Upgrade Inspectr via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade inspectr
```

Verify:

```bash
inspectr --version
```

### npm

Upgrade a global npm install:

```bash
npm update -g @inspectr/inspectr
```

If you want to force a clean reinstall:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @inspectr/inspectr
npm install -g @inspectr/inspectr
```

Verify:

```bash
inspectr --version
```

---

### Binary

1. Download the newest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr/releases).
2. Replace your existing `inspectr` binary with the new one.

If needed, make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./inspectr
```

Verify:

```bash
./inspectr --version
```

---

### Docker

Pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/inspectr-hq/inspectr:latest
```

If you run Inspectr with `docker run`, stop/remove the old container and start a new one using the updated image:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4004:4004 -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/inspectr-hq/inspectr:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

If you use Docker Compose, pull and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

To verify the running container is updated:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Next step

Explore the [configuration options](/docs/configuration/cli-options/) to tailor Inspectr to your workflow.

If something looks off after upgrading, check the release notes on GitHub and compare your current flags/config with the latest CLI docs.
