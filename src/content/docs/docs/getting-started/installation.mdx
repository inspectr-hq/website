[//]: # (# Install Inspectr)

There are multiple ways to install **Inspectr**, depending on your preferred platform and workflow. Whether you're testing something quickly or setting up a full dev toolchain, Inspectr makes it easy to get started.

## Option 1: Use `npx` (Zero Install)

For a quick test run without installing anything globally:

```bash
npx @inspectr/inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

* This downloads and runs the latest version on demand.
* Great for trying Inspectr without committing to a full install.
* The UI is available at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)

---

## Option 2: Install via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap inspectr-hq/inspectr
brew install inspectr
```

* Easiest way for macOS users to keep Inspectr up to date.
* Works well with terminal workflows.

Run it with:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

## Option 3: Install via npm (Node.js users)

```bash
npm install -g @inspectr/inspectr
```

* Installs Inspectr globally via the Node package manager.
* Useful for users already in the Node.js ecosystem.

Run Inspectr like this:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```
