[//]: # (# ⚡ Quick Start)

Ready to debug your API traffic with Inspectr? This guide walks you through the fastest way to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* Installed Inspectr ([see installation guide](/getting-started/install))
* A local API or web service to test (e.g. running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

---

<Steps>

  <ol>

    <li>
      ### Start Your Backend (Optional)

      If you're testing against your own backend, make sure it’s running:

      ```bash
      # Example: Node.js/Express app on port 3000
      npm start
      ```
    </li>

    <li>
      ### Start Inspectr

      Run Inspectr and point it to your local backend:

      ```bash
      inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
      ```

      * This starts the Inspectr proxy on port `8080`.
      * The Inspectr App UI is available at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004).

    </li>

    <li>
      ### Make Your First Request

      Send a request through Inspectr to see it in action:

      ```bash
      curl http://localhost:8080/hello
      ```

      In the **terminal**, you'll see a color-coded log of the request.

      In the **browser**, go to [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004) to view full request/response details in real time.

    </li>

    <li>
      ### Inspect in the App

      Use the Inspectr UI to:

      * View headers, query params, and request body
      * See backend response data
      * Filter or replay previous requests

    </li>

  </ol>

</Steps>

### Optional: Use Catch Mode (No Backend)

If you don’t have a backend, enable catch mode to accept and inspect any HTTP requests:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true
```

Every request will return a `200 OK` with no forwarding. Great for testing tools or webhooks!

### Optional: Expose Publicly

To expose Inspectr to receive external requests (like webhooks):

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000 --expose --channel=hello-world --channel-code=secure123
```

Your service is now available at:

```
https://hello-world.in-spectr.dev
```
