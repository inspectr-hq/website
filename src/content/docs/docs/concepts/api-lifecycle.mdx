API-first or Spec-driven development often follows a clear lifecycle; from defining your OpenAPI spec to monitoring production traffic.

I talk about API-first or Spec-driven development in blog posts like ["An introduction to spec-driven API development"](https://www.apideck.com/blog/spec-driven-development-part-1) at [Apideck](https://www.apideck.com/) and at several Meetups (["Unlocking the Power of Spec-Driven API Development"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXRstde1SeA&t=198s))

The concept was nicely visualised by this diagram from Mulesoft (a long time ago), where the API spec is used as a starting point.

With 3 clear stages: Design, Implementation, Management

- **Design**: The creation of the specification API contracts, with designing, simulating it with Mocks, Collect feedback from stakeholders & validate with linting (is it valid)
- **Implementation**: Development of code & validation (testing) to match the Spec. Refine the specification to match the final result
- **Management**: The stage where you deploy & monitor the API

This can also be linked to [API Lifecycle Management](https://medium.com/api-center/api-lifecycle-management-9fb0caaa41de), like the excellent explanation by [TR Goodwill](https://medium.com/@trgoodwill) from 2022, resulting in very similar stages but with some small nuances

<Image src={specDrivenStages} alt="API first stages" height="500" />

- **Design**: The creation of the specification API contracts, with validation and documentation creation
- **Build & Test**: Development of code & validation (testing) to match the Spec. Refine the specification or application to publish the final result
- **Release**: The stage where you deploy & monitor the API, and evolve to keep everything up-to-date but also sunset parts of the API

Inspectr fits into each stage, providing tooling that saves time and reduces friction.

## Build Stage – Design & Mocking

Before any code is written, you can use Inspectr’s **Mocking with OpenAPI** feature to validate your API design. With the [`--mock-backend`](../../configuration/cli-options/#mocking-with-openapi) flag, Inspectr serves responses directly from your specification, even when no backend exists.

```bash
inspectr --mock-backend=./openapi.yaml
```

Dynamic mocks are also available via `--mock-dynamic=true`, letting frontend and SDK teams iterate immediately.

**Benefits**

- Get started in minutes to **iterate and try the model** the while designing and specifying the endpoints.
- **Start frontend work** while the backend is still in progress.
- **Skip deploying** a temporary staging service just to try out your spec and cut hours of setting up that environment.

## Build Stage – Local Development

During implementation, Inspectr acts as a real-time proxy and traffic inspector. As documented in the [Key Features](../../index/#key-features) list, it provides **Real-Time Proxying**, a live **UI Dashboard**, and the ability to **Replay Requests**. Start Inspectr alongside your backend to capture each request and response:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

Every operation is stored locally and visible in the app at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004).

**Benefits**

- **Instant visibility** into each request/response without extra logging code.
- **Replay failed calls** to debug issues faster than re-running your entire test suite.

## Build Stage – Testing

Need to simulate errors or latency? Inspectr supports [Response Overrides](./response-override/) so you can force specific status codes or delays without touching your code. When you’re ready to test webhooks or third‑party callbacks, run Inspectr with `--catch=true` and optionally `--expose` to create a public endpoint:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true --expose --channel=test-api --channel-code=secret123
```

This exposes a secure URL such as `https://test-api.in-spectr.dev` for remote services while logging everything in real time.

**Benefits**

- **Validate integrations quickly** without setting up a full staging environment.
- **Simulate failures** and edge cases to see how your API handles them before going live, saving hours of manual testing.

## Build Stage – Pre‑Deployment Demos

The Inspectr Ingress also streamlines staging reviews. By using [`--expose`](../../configuration/cli-options/#public-exposure), teammates and stakeholders can interact with your local build before it’s deployed. The exposed URL live only for the duration of your session, so there’s no cleanup required.

**Benefits**

- **Share feature previews instantly**, saving time normally spent pushing to remote staging.
- **Gather feedback earlier**, reducing the number of deployment cycles.

## Build Release – Monitoring & Troubleshooting

Inspectr keeps a history of every operation. As described in the [Architecture](../../concepts/architecture/#inspectr-proxy) docs, historical requests and responses can be kept. This history enables quick search and replay to reproduce issues even after they occur.

**Benefits**

- **Persist request history** so you can troubleshoot issues days instead of wasting time recreating scenarios.
- **Replay any call** to reproduce bugs without needing to capture fresh traffic, speeding up root-cause analysis.

By using Inspectr during each phase: Design, Build & Test and Release; you gain time spent on technical plumbing, have shorter feedback loops and gain visibility across your entire API lifecycle.
