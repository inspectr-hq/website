[//]: # (# Inspectr Architecture Overview)

Inspectr is a lightweight yet powerful proxy and inspection tool that helps developers debug, analyze, and simulate API traffic. It consists of modular components that work together to provide real-time visibility and control over HTTP requests.

## Core Components

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

### <IconInspectr width={24} height={24}/> Inspectr Proxy

The Inspectr proxy acts as an HTTP middleman between clients and your backend service.

* Listens on a local port (e.g. `:8080`)
* Captures incoming requests and optionally forwards them to a backend
* Logs and broadcasts requests/responses for inspection

#### Mock & Catch Engine

Built-in Inspectr Proxy, used when no backend is defined or when mocking is required.

* **Catch Mode**: Returns a `200 OK` without forwarding
* **Mock Mode**: Uses OpenAPI specs to simulate backend behavior
* Supports dynamic and example-based responses

#### Data Store

Captures all operations (requests/responses) and stores them locally:

* In-memory (ephemeral) or SQLite (persistent)
* Indexed for searching and filtering in the API & UI


### <IconInspectr width={24} height={24} from="#ff8c00" to='#ffd700'/>  Inspectr App (Web UI)

A web-based dashboard for viewing and analyzing captured requests.

* Accessible at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)
* Displays live request/response data
* Supports filtering, replaying, and metadata inspection

### <IconInspectr width={24} height={24} from="#26ff00" to='#9fe491'/> Inspectr Ingress (Public Exposure)

An optional cloud service to expose your local Inspectr proxy securely to the public. Creates a public ingress endpoint that forwards incoming requests to your local Inspectr Proxy.

* Subdomain routing on `in-spectr.dev`
* Forwards external traffic to your local Inspectr instance
* Supports secure channels via `--channel-code`

---

## Request Lifecycle

1. **Receive**: Inspectr listens for HTTP requests or Webhook events on the configured `--listen` port.
2. **Inspect**: Headers, method, URL, and body are parsed.
3. **Route**:

* If `--backend` is set â†’ forward request to a backend service and capture the response.
* If `--mock-backend` is set â†’ generate response based on OpenAPI.
* If `--catch` is enabled â†’ return default 200 OK.

4. **Response**: Return the response to the client

## Summary

Inspectrâ€™s modular architecture allows it to adapt to many workflowsâ€”from debugging local APIs to capturing external webhooks. Its combination of proxying, mocking, and live inspection provides a full API traffic debugging toolkit.
