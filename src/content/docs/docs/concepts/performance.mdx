Understand how Inspectr delivers fast, secure request handling without compromising throughput or privacy.

## Why speed and performance matter

At **Inspectr**, we take performance and privacy seriously.

Every design choice is driven by a simple principle:

> *Handle every request as fast and safely as possible*.

### Built for throughput

Inspectr is designed to process **large volumes of requests per second** without introducing bottlenecks. The architecture is optimized around the **hot path**: receiving an incoming request and returning the response immediately.

No added delays. No hidden layers. Just speed.

### Why we chose Go

Go lets Inspectr ship as a single binary that is easy to run anywhere.

- **High performance** with a small memory footprint (about 50MB RAM in typical usage).
- **Minimal external dependencies**, which lowers the attack surface and keeps upgrades simple.
- **Single, static binarie**s that are easy to run, distribute, deploy, and trust.

## Keeping it local

> _**Full Data Privacy & Control**:
All operations are stored local-only; ensuring fast throughput, reduced latency, and improved security by keeping sensitive data on your own system_.

Inspectr was designed as a **local-first tool**, not a SaaS service. All captured requests and responses are processed, analyzed, and stored entirely on your machine - never sent to any remote server.This means you remain in full control of your data, your keys, and all payloads.

Even when using the `--expose` option, Inspectr functions purely as a lightweight proxy that forwards encrypted traffic directly to your local instance without retaining or inspecting it on the ingress side.

This local-only approach means: no hidden backends or centralized data stores — just your environment, under your control.
It’s a privacy-by-design model that keeps sensitive information where it belongs: with you.

In contrast to traditional tunneling or debugging tools, Inspectr provides the same convenience and real-time inspection capabilities without ever transferring ownership of your data.

## Processing beyond the request/response

Inspectr includes optional capabilities that never interfere with the primary request pipeline.

- Operations archive for historical context.
- In-app SSE streams to power the real-time dashboard.
- Live statistics to watch performance metrics.
- Rules engine to automate request handling.

Each feature runs alongside the hot path so Inspectr can scale while staying responsive. All are carefully designed so they **never impact request handling performance**.

## Security, privacy, and performance - together

Performance without security is dangerous; security without privacy is incomplete. Inspectr delivers all three, designed for developers who need speed without sacrificing control.
