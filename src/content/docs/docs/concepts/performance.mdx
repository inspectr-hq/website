## Why speed and performance matter

At **Inspectr**, we take performance and security seriously. Every design choice is driven by a simple principle: *handle every request as fast and safely as possible*.

## Built for throughput

Inspectr is designed to process **large volumes of requests per second** without introducing bottlenecks. The architecture is optimized around the **hot path**: receiving an incoming request and returning the response immediately.

No added delays. No hidden layers. Just speed.

## Why we chose Go

Go lets Inspectr ship as a single binary that is easy to run anywhere.

- **High performance** with a small memory footprint (about 50MB RAM in typical usage).
- **Minimal external dependencies**, which lowers the attack surface and keeps upgrades simple.
- **Single, static binarie**s that are easy to run, distribute, deploy, and trust.

## Keeping it local

All operations are stored local-only; ensuring fast throughput, reduced latency, and improved security by keeping sensitive data on your own system.

## Processing beyond the request/response

Inspectr includes optional capabilities that never interfere with the primary request pipeline.

- Operations archive for historical context.
- In-app SSE streams to power the real-time dashboard.
- Live statistics to watch performance metrics.
- Rules engine to automate request handling.

Each feature runs alongside the hot path so Inspectr can scale while staying responsive. All are carefully designed so they **never impact request handling performance**.

## Security and performance, together

Performance without security is risky; security without performance is frustrating. Inspectr is commited to deliver both at once so you can rely on it even in demanding environments.
