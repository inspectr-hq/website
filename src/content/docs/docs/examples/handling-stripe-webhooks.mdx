[//]: # (# Handling Stripe Webhooks with Inspectr)

Stripe sends webhook events to notify your application about things like successful payments or subscription changes. With Inspectr, you can capture, inspect, and replay these eventsâ€”even when developing locally.

---

## Why Use Inspectr for Stripe Webhooks?

* See the **raw payloads** Stripe sends
* Verify headers like `Stripe-Signature`
* Debug issues without needing to re-trigger events
* Replay captured events multiple times

---

### Prerequisites

* A [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)
* Inspectr installed ([Install guide â†’](/docs/getting-started/installation))
* Stripe CLI (optional, for testing locally)

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr in Catch Mode

You donâ€™t need a backend during early development:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true --expose --channel=stripe-webhooks --channel-code=webhooks123
```

This will:

* Accept incoming requests on both `http://localhost:8080` and `https://stripe-webhooks.in-spectr.dev`
* Automatically return a `200 OK` to all requests
* Display all webhook events in the Inspectr App UI (`http://localhost:4004`)

---

## Step 2: Configure Stripe to Send Events

Login to your Stripe account, goto [Stripe Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks) and start the wizard to create a webhook destination:

<Image src={stripeStart} alt="Stripe Webhook Add" />


In the Stripe Dashboard or Stripe CLI, set your webhook endpoint to:

```
https://stripe-webhooks.in-spectr.dev/stripe
```

<Image src={stripeDestination} alt="Stripe Webhook Destination" width="600" />

Or use the Stripe CLI to forward events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to https://stripe-webhooks.in-spectr.dev/stripe
```

---

## Step 3: Inspect Events in Real Time

As Stripe sends events, youâ€™ll see them in:

* Your **terminal**: color-coded request logs
* The **Inspectr App**: full event details, headers, body, and timestamp

You can:

* Replay events to another backend (once it's live)
* Download payloads for offline testing
* View signature headers to validate signing logic

---

## Step 4: Validate Signatures (Optional)

Inspectr captures the `Stripe-Signature` header so you can:

* Extract and test your signing secret manually
* Confirm timestamp & signature values in the UI

 For production validation, you must verify Stripe's signature on your server.

## Step 5: Replay Webhooks to Local Backend

Once your backend is running locally:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000 --expose --channel=stripe-webhooks --channel-code=webhooks123
```

Now replay the captured Stripe events to your real handler at `http://localhost:3000/stripe`.

---

## Summary

Inspectr is a powerful companion for working with Stripe webhooks:

* Capture and analyze events safely
* Replay and test integrations on demand
* Eliminate the pain of re-triggering third-party systems
