[//]: # (# Using Inspectr with PHP)

PHP's built-in web server makes it easy to spin up lightweight APIs for prototypes, demos, or webhook receivers.
Inspectr sits in front of your PHP app so you can see every request, replay traffic, and optionally share your endpoint with the outside world.

This guide shows how to connect Inspectr to a basic PHP application.

---

## Prerequisites

* PHP 8.1+
* Inspectr installed ([Install guide â†’](/docs/getting-started/installation))

---

## Step 1: Serve a PHP Endpoint

Create a minimal project structure:

```bash
mkdir php-demo
cd php-demo
mkdir public
```

Inside `public/index.php`, return a JSON response so it is easy to see in Inspectr:

```php
<?php
// public/index.php
header('Content-Type: application/json');

echo json_encode([
    'message' => 'Hello from plain PHP!',
    'timestamp' => date(DATE_ATOM)
]);
```

Start PHPâ€™s development server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Your PHP app is now available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Step 2: Proxy Traffic with Inspectr

In a new terminal, launch Inspectr and point it at the PHP server:

```bash
inspectr --listen=:8080 --backend=http://localhost:8000
```

Send a request through Inspectr to confirm it forwards correctly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Youâ€™ll see the request in the terminal output and inside the Inspectr App UI ([http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)).

Inspectr will:

* Relay the request to PHP
* Capture headers, payload, and response timing
* Let you replay or modify the call during development

---

## Optional: Accept External Requests

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

Enable Inspectrâ€™s ingress mode to make your local PHP endpoint reachable from third-party services:

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://localhost:8000 \
  --expose \
  --channel=php-demo \
  --channel-code=php123
```

Your PHP app becomes available at:

```
https://php-demo.in-spectr.dev
```

Use this URL as a webhook target or share it with teammates. You can pause or revoke access at any time by stopping Inspectr
or rotating the channel code.

---

## Step 3: Iterate with Confidence

With Inspectr in place you can:

* Inspect and replay requests without editing PHP code
* Capture failing webhook payloads for later debugging
* Toggle between private proxying and public ingress in a single command

---

## Summary

Inspectr acts as a smart proxy for PHP applications:

* Works with the built-in PHP server or full frameworks
* Adds a visual timeline of requests and responses
* Simplifies testing integrations that expect a public URL
