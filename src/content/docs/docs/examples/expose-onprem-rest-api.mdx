Running REST APIs inside a private network is common for enterprise or self-hosted setups. You can place Inspectr in front of your internal service to expose it temporarily and inspect all incoming traffic.

In many enterprise networks, opening up a service to the outside world means requesting firewall changes, setting up NAT rules, or configuring DMZ proxies. Each of these steps can involve multiple configurations and complex network policies. Inspectr avoids that headache: run it on the same machine as your API and it creates a secure single outbound HTTP connection to the Inspectr Cloud. Because most organizations already allow outbound traffic, you can safely share a public URL without altering inbound firewall rules.

## Prerequisites

* Inspectr installed ([Install guide â†’](/docs/getting-started/installation)) on a on-premise setup
* An internal REST API running on your network, for example `http://intranet.local:5000`

---

## Step 1: Ensure Your API is Running

Make sure your on-prem API is reachable from the machine where you run Inspectr.


Example:
```bash
curl http://intranet.local:5000/health
```

Inspectr will forward traffic to this address.

---

## Step 2: Configure & Run Inspectr on-premise

Run Inspectr and point it to your internal service.

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://intranet.local:5000 \
  --expose \
  --channel=internal-api \
  --channel-code=access123
```

Your API will be reachable via:

```
https://internal-api.in-spectr.dev
```

Share this URL with partners or tools that must access your on-prem service.

* Inspectr listens locally on port `8080`.
* All requests are forwarded to your on-prem API.
* View captured traffic at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004).

---

## Step 3: Inspect

Use the Inspectr App UI to:

* Monitor all requests hitting your internal API
* Inspect headers and bodies for debugging

---

## Summary

Inspectr lets you safely expose and debug on-prem REST APIs without complex tunneling. Start it in front of your service, optionally enable public exposure, and inspect traffic in real time.
