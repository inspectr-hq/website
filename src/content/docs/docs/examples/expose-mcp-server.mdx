[//]: # (# ðŸ§  Exposing a Model Context Protocol &#40;MCP&#41; Server with Inspectr)

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) is an open standard for enabling language models to use tools, retrieve data, and operate over structured inputs. If you're running a local MCP server, Inspectr lets you expose it securely to the internet and inspect real-time traffic.

This guide walks you through exposing your MCP server using Inspectr.

---

## Prerequisites

* A running MCP-compatible server (e.g. on `http://localhost:3000`)
* Inspectr installed ([Install Guide â†’](/docs/getting-started/installation))

---

## Step 1: Start Your MCP Server

Make sure your server is running locally:

```bash
mcp-server --port 3000
```

Or however you start your local MCP-compatible service.

---

## Step 2: Start Inspectr to Forward Requests

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

* Inspectr listens on port `8080`
* Forwards traffic to your MCP server on port `3000`
* Captures and displays traffic in the App UI at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)

---

## Step 3: Expose Your MCP Server Publicly

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

To allow external access:

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://localhost:3000 \
  --expose \
  --channel=mcp-demo \
  --channel-code=mcpserver123
```

Your MCP server is now available at:

```
https://mcp-demo.in-spectr.dev
```

---

## Monitor and Replay

Inspect all traffic in the Inspectr UI:

* Live requests and responses
* Request headers and bodies
* Replay past requests
* Filter by endpoint or method

---

## Summary

Inspectr makes it easy to:

* Expose your local MCP server to the internet
* Debug incoming traffic
* Share model tools and endpoints securely
