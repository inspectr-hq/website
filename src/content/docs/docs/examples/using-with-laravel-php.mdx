[//]: # (# Using Inspectr with Laravel &#40;PHP&#41;)

Laravel is a popular PHP framework for building web applications and APIs. Inspectr lets you inspect, debug, and securely expose your Laravel endpoints for testing or integration with third-party services.

This guide walks you through using Inspectr as a proxy in front of a Laravel app.

---

## Prerequisites

* PHP 8.1+
* Laravel installed (`laravel new myapp` or via Composer)
* Inspectr installed ([Install guide â†’](/getting-started/installation))

---

## Step 1: Start Your Laravel App

If you havenâ€™t already, create and start a Laravel application:

```bash
laravel new myapp
cd myapp
php artisan serve --port=8000
```

Laravel will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Step 2: Start Inspectr as a Proxy

Run Inspectr to forward incoming requests to your Laravel app:

```bash
inspectr --listen=:8080 --backend=http://localhost:8000
```

Now you can access your Laravel routes via Inspectr at `http://localhost:8080`.

For example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/user
```

Inspectr will:

* Log and inspect the request
* Forward it to your Laravel backend
* Show the full request/response in the Inspectr App UI ([http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004))

---

## Optional: Expose Laravel Publicly

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

Use Inspectrâ€™s public ingress mode to receive traffic from external services (e.g., webhooks):

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://localhost:8000 \
  --expose \
  --channel=laravel-demo \
  --channel-code=laravel123
```

Your Laravel API will now be available at:

```
https://laravel-demo.in-spectr.dev
```

---

## Step 3: Debug and Replay

In the Inspectr App:

* Watch live traffic from frontend clients or third-party systems
* Replay webhook requests directly to Laravel
* See request payloads, headers, methods, and status codes

---

## Summary

Inspectr makes Laravel development and integration easier by:

* Acting as a transparent proxy in front of your app
* Allowing safe, temporary public exposure
* Providing a UI for inspection and request replay
