[//]: # (## **Lost Visibility During Test Runs**)

When you’re testing APIs using tools like **[Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman)**, **[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)**, or **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman/)**, you can easily run dozens, even hundreds, of requests in a single collection.

But once those requests start flying, **visibility quickly disappears**:

- **Newman’s** **--verbose** mode floods the console with raw data. Gives you a details of the requests made, but unreadable at scale.
- **Bruno’s CLI output** is clean and compact, yet lacks a way to drill into each request and response once the run is complete.
- **Postman’s GUI** shows individual results but makes it diffucult to compare or trace changes across multiple calls.

As a result, debugging test failures or investigating API behavior means **rerunning collections**, manually logging payloads, or digging through partial console output  instead of simply *seeing* what happened.

## Use Inspectr for a better visibility

**Inspectr** sits between your API client and your backend.

<FlowBase client:only="react" />

You point your requests to Inspectr (the proxy), and it transparently forwards them to your real API, capturing everything along the way.

This gives you a live, navigable view of all requests and responses:

- Explore headers, body, status, and latency.
- Filter by method, endpoint, or status code.
- Compare calls side-by-side and replay them instantly.
- Keep using your existing tools — no test script changes required.

### **One-time setup**

Start Inspectr and forward to your backend (example backend on port 3000):

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
# Proxy listens on http://localhost:8080 (default)
# Open the Inspectr UI at http://localhost:4004 to browse captured traffic
```

From here, just point your API tool to http://localhost:8080 instead of your backend, that’s it!

## Newman

[Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) is the command-line companion to Postman. It runs Postman Collections locally or in CI/CD pipelines, executing tests and reporting results.

**The typical problem:**

While Newman supports `--verbose` logging, it still produces a **flat stream of request details** that’s difficult to navigate. When a run fails, it’s hard to inspect individual request bodies or correlate them with their responses.

**How to use Inspectr with Newman:**

1. Ensure your requests use a `{{baseUrl}}` variable in the collection.

2. Run your collection ([CLI options](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-options/)), pointing it to Inspectr:

```bash
newman run ./collection.json --env-var "baseUrl=http://localhost:8080"
```

<Image src={newmanRun} alt="Run Newman" />

3. Open **http://localhost:4004** in your browser to explore each captured call in detail.

## Bruno

[Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/) is a modern, open-source graphical API client that stores requests as plain files, with a user-friendly UI, which runs collections through its fast CLI. It’s designed for speed, simplicity, and version control.

**The typical problem:**

While Bruno’s CLI output is concise, it’s **not built for easy debugging**. Once a run completes, you can’t easily inspect request/response details or compare calls between iterations.

**How to use Inspectr with Bruno:**

1. Reference a base variable (e.g., `{{baseUrl}}`) in your .bru requests.

2. Run Bruno ([CLI options](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-cli/commandOptions)), overriding the variable to Inspectr :

```bash
bru run ./apis --env dev --env-var "baseUrl=http://localhost:8080"
```
<Image src={brunoRun} alt="Run Bruno" />

or for a single request:

```bash
bru run ./apis/users/get-users.bru --env dev --env-var baseUrl=http://localhost:8080
```

3. Open **http://localhost:4004** to browse and analyze all captured requests and responses.

## Postman

[Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/) is a graphical API client, probably the most commonly known API client, that lets you build, send, and test requests interactively; complete with collections, scripts, and environments.

**The typical problem:**

Postman’s History tab shows what you’ve sent, but navigating across similar calls or comparing payloads and responses can be **tedious and manual**. It’s especially tricky during multi-step workflows or debugging complex APIs.

**How to use Inspectr with Postman:**

1. Define a baseUrl variable (at collection or global scope).

2. Set it to http://localhost:8080.

3. Update your request URLs to use `{{baseUrl}}/path`.

4. Send requests as usual — Inspectr will capture and display them automatically.

### Summary

Newman, Bruno, and Postman are excellent to easily **build** & **run** your requests.

Inspectr completes the picture by letting you **see** requests & responses - clearly, visually, and interactively.

Instead of guessing what happened during a test run, you can open Inspectr and immediately explore, search, compare, and replay every call that went through.
