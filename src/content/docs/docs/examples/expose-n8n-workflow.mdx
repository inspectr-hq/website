[//]: # (# Exposing n8n Workflows with Inspectr)

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a powerful open-source workflow automation tool. Many workflows start with a webhook triggerâ€”but exposing your local n8n instance to receive those webhooks can be tricky.

With Inspectr, you can expose your local n8n webhook endpoints securely to the public and monitor all incoming traffic in real time.

## Data Flow

<FlowN8n client:only="react" />

## Why Use Inspectr with n8n?

* Securely expose local n8n webhooks (no tunnel config needed)
* Debug and replay webhook requests
* View incoming headers and payloads in the UI
* Share your webhook URL with third-party systems instantly

---

## Prerequisites

* [n8n installed](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) and running locally (e.g. via [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) or [NPM](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/))
* Inspectr installed ([Install guide â†’](/docs/getting-started/install))

---

## Step 1: Start n8n Locally

Run n8n locally with webhook endpoints enabled. For example:

```bash
npx n8n
```

or via Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -e N8N_HOST=localhost \
  -e N8N_PORT=5678 \
  -e N8N_PROTOCOL=http \
  -e WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  n8nio/n8n
```

Add a Webhook trigger to a n8n workflow.

Make sure your workflow includes a **Webhook Trigger** node with an appropriate path (e.g. `/inspectr`).

## Step 2: Start Inspectr to Forward Requests to n8n

Now launch Inspectr to forward incoming requests to your local n8n server:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:5678 --expose --channel=n8n-demo --channel-code=n8ndemo123
```

* Inspectr will expose your service on:

```
https://n8n-demo.in-spectr.dev
```

* Any request to that domain will be forwarded to your local n8n instance
* Youâ€™ll see real-time logs in both the terminal and Inspectr App UI

---

## Step 3: Configure Third-Party Webhook or Trigger Event

Use your public Inspectr URL when setting up webhook integrations:

```
https://n8n-demo.in-spectr.dev/webhook-test/inspectr
```

This replaces `http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/inspectr` and allows services like Stripe, GitHub, or Zapier to reach your local workflow.

For this demo, you can trigger the n8n workflow by opening the trigger URL in your browser.

```bash
https://n8n-demo.in-spectr.dev/webhook-test/inspectr
```

<Image src={n8nTriggered} alt="n8n Webhook triggered" />

The n8n webhook workflow running on your local machine, was succesfully triggered remotely

## Step 4: Inspect and Replay

* Watch incoming events in [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)
* Use the Inspectr UI to inspect payloads, status codes, and headers
* Replay captured requests into your workflow with one click

---

## Tips

* Add request validation logic in your n8n workflow if needed
* Use Inspectr even in production-like environments to log webhook traffic
