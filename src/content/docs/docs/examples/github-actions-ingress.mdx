[//]: # (# Inspect API Tests in GitHub Actions)

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

Running API tests inside GitHub Actions is a typically workflow and part of testing pipeline, but it can be hard to see exactly what the runner sends and receives. Inspectr solves this by exposing a **remote ingress domain** that forwards traffic from your CI job to your local Inspectr instance.

---

## Why Use Remote Ingress?

* Capture every request made during CI runs
* Replay failing calls without re-triggering the workflow
* Share a single endpoint with multiple runners

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr with `--expose`

Start Inspectr locally (or on any reachable machine) and open a public channel:

```bash
inspectr \
  --listen=:8080 \
  --backend=http://api.staging.com \
  --expose \
  --channel=ci-tests \
  --channel-code=secret123
```

Inspectr creates a public URL, for example:

```
https://ci-tests.in-spectr.dev
```

All traffic hitting this URL will be forwarded to the staging/testing/... service and recorded.

---

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions

Point your tests at the Inspectr URL. A minimal workflow might look like:

```yaml
name: API Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      BASE_URL: https://ci-tests.in-spectr.dev
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

Update your tests so they use the `BASE_URL` environment variable when sending requests.

---

## Step 3: Inspect the Requests

While the workflow runs, Inspectr logs everything:

* Watch the CLI output or open `http://localhost:4004`
* View full request and response details
* Replay or modify requests from the UI

---

## Problem Solved

Without Inspectr, capturing traffic from GitHub Actions is tricky and usually requires custom logging. With a remote ingress domain you get real-time visibility into every request that are triggered in your GitHub CI workflow.

## Benefits

* Centralized API debugging across all CI jobs
* No need to expose your test environment directly
* Works with any language or test framework
