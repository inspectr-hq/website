[//]: # (# Using Inspectr with Express)

Inspectr is a great tool for debugging and analyzing API traffic in Node.js applications, including those built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/). You can use it to inspect incoming requests to your Express app by placing Inspectr as a **proxy** in front of it.

---

## Use Inspectr as a Proxy

Inspectr sits in front of your app and captures traffic before forwarding it to your Express backend.

### 1. Start Your Express App

Make sure your app is running, for example on port 3000:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received:', req.body);
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'OK' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 2. Start Inspectr in Front of Your App

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

Now, make requests to `http://localhost:8080/api/data`. Inspectr will:

* Log the request in the terminal
* Show it in the Inspectr App UI
* Forward it to your Express app on port 3000

---

## Optional: Expose Your Express API Publicly

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

You can expose your local Express server with Inspectr Ingress:

```bash
inspectr \
  --backend=http://localhost:3000 \
  --expose \
  --channel=express-demo \
  --channel-code=express123
```

Your public endpoint will be:

```
https://express-demo.in-spectr.dev
```

---

## Summary

Inspectr enhances Express development by giving you full visibility into all traffic and making debugging simple and interactive. While middleware-based capture is not supported, proxy mode works great for local and public exposure workflows.
