[Ollama](https://ollama.com) is a local LLM runner that lets you serve AI models on your own machine. Inspectr makes it easy to expose your Ollama API to the internet for demos, integrations, or remote collaboration.

This guide walks through exposing your Ollama instance securely using Inspectr.

---

## Why Use Inspectr with Ollama?

* Share a live AI model without deploying it
* Inspect and debug request/response cycles
* Secure access with a one-time code
* Replay or log incoming requests

---

### Prerequisites

* [Ollama installed and running locally](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
* Inspectr installed ([Install guide →](/docs/getting-started/installation/))

Start Ollama locally:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Finally, in a separate shell, run a model:

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

Ollama listens on:

```
http://localhost:11434
```

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr in Front of Ollama

```bash
inspectr \
  --backend=http://localhost:11434 \
  --expose \
  --channel=ollama-demo \
  --channel-code=ollama123
```

Inspectr will:

* Forward all traffic from `https://ollama-demo.in-spectr.dev` to your local Ollama
* Log and show all requests/responses in the App UI
* Require callers to include the access code `ollama123`

---

## Example Request

With Inspectr running, you can now send prompts remotely:

```bash
curl https://ollama-demo.in-spectr.dev/api/generate \
  -d '{ "model": "llama3.2", "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?" }'
```

## Inspect in Real Time

Use the Inspectr App UI ([http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)) to:

* Monitor prompts sent to Ollama
* Inspect request headers, bodies, and responses
* Replay past requests to test model behavior

---

## Summary

Inspectr + Ollama is ideal for:

* Sharing demos with teammates or clients
* Testing integration pipelines
* Observing and replaying LLM behavior remotely
