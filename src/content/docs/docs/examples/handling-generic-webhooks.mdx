[//]: # (# Handling Generic Webhooks with Inspectr)
Webhooks are used across many platforms to send real-time data to your services. Whether you're integrating with custom apps, IoT devices, or internal systems, Inspectr gives you a simple and powerful way to capture, inspect, and replay any HTTP webhook.

---

## Why Use Inspectr for Webhooks?

* No backend needed to start debugging
* Instantly expose a public endpoint
* See request headers, bodies, and metadata in real time
* Replay requests without re-triggering the sender

---

## Common Scenarios

* Catching webhooks from custom SaaS platforms
* Debugging IoT or edge device payloads
* Monitoring internal app integrations
* Logging events from CI/CD tools (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins)

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr in Catch Mode

Run Inspectr in catch mode with public exposure:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true --expose --channel=wehhooks --channel-code=webhooks123
```

* This creates a public endpoint:

```
https://wehhooks.in-spectr.dev
```

* Any request sent to this URL is captured, logged, and acknowledged with `200 OK`
* UI: [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)

---

## Step 2: Point Your Webhook Sender to Inspectr

In your platform or service, configure the webhook destination:

```
https://wehhooks.in-spectr.dev/my-webhook-endpoint
```

You can use any path. Inspectr will capture:

* HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* Headers (e.g. auth, signature)
* Body (JSON, XML, raw text, etc.)

---

## Step 3: Inspect the Payload

Once the webhook is sent:

* View it in your **terminal** (color-coded log)
* Open the **Inspectr App** in your browser
* Filter by method, path, or timestamp
* See full request body and headers

---

## Step 4: Replay Events

From the Inspectr App, click **Replay** to send the webhook again to a new backend URL:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000 --expose --channel=wehhooks --channel-code=secret123
```

Now all captured webhooks will be forwarded to your local backend, and can be replayed from the UI.

---

## Summary

Inspectr gives you everything you need to work with generic webhooks:

* Expose endpoints publicly with zero setup
* Inspect full payloads and metadata
* Replay and forward to local services
* Secure access with optional authentication
