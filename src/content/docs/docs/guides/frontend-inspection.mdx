Inspectr can help you debug outgoing HTTP requests made by your frontend applications. With a single URL change, you can inspect request details, trace issues, and test interactions without touching your backend.

---

## Use Cases

You're developing a web app and want to:

* See the actual requests your frontend sends
* Inspect headers, methods, and payloads
* View backend responses
* Debug issues like CORS, 4xx/5xx errors, or missing data

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr with a Backend

Point Inspectr to your API backend:

```bash
inspectr --backend=https://api.example.com
```

This sets Inspectr to:

* Receive requests on `http://localhost:8080` (use `--listen=` to change this)
* Forward them to `https://api.example.com`
* Log and display traffic in real time

---

## Step 2: Update Frontend Base URL

Modify your frontend to send API requests to Inspectr:

```js
// Before:
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
```

```js
// After:
fetch("http://localhost:8080/data")
```

* Works with any framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
* Works with any HTTP client (fetch, axios, etc.)
* No backend changes required

---

## Step 3: Inspect in the UI

Visit [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004) to:

* View requests and responses
* Monitor headers, bodies, and status codes
* Replay requests during development

---

## Optional: Enable CORS backend Handling

If you want to validate the original backend CORS validation, you can turn off the CORS handling by Inspectr and let the CORS setting of the backend handle the validation:

```bash
inspectr --backend=https://api.example.com --backend-cors=true
```

By default, Inspectr will allow preflight OPTIONS requests and pass through headers appropriately.

---

## Tips

* Use filters in the UI to isolate specific endpoints
* Replay requests after changing frontend code
* Use override headers to simulate errors and delays in mock/catch modes
