Inspectr helps you inspect, trace, and debug API requests and responses in real time. Whether you're working on a backend service or testing an integration, Inspectr gives you the visibility you need.

---

## Step 1: Start Your Backend Service

Ensure your API service is running locally. For example, a backend on port `3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
python app.py
```

---

## Step 2: Start Inspectr as a Proxy

Use the `--backend` flag to forward requests from Inspectr to your backend:

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

* Inspectr listens on the default port `8080` (use `--listen=` to change this).
* Incoming requests will be forwarded to `localhost:3000`.
* All requests/responses will be captured and shown in:

* **Console log** (color-coded summary)
* **UI App** ([http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004))

---

## Step 3: Send Requests

Send requests to your backend through Inspectr:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

Or update your frontend/API client to target `http://localhost:8080` instead of the original backend.

---

## Step 4: Explore in the UI

Visit [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004) to:

* Inspect the request method, path, headers, body
* View the forwarded backend response
* Filter by status code, method, endpoint
* Replay past requests for regression testing

---

## Debugging Tips

Use Inspectr to debug:

* 4xx/5xx responses with full request visibility
* Misconfigured headers or missing tokens
* Wrong HTTP methods or paths
* Combine with browser dev tools or API clients (Postman, Insomnia)
