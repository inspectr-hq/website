Inspectr supports special headers that let you override the response behavior for a request. This is helpful when you're testing edge cases, simulating failures, or customizing mock data on the fly.

This guide covers how to use response override headers and what they do.

---

##  When to Use Overrides

* Simulate network latency
* Force specific HTTP status codes (e.g. 404, 500)
* Choose a specific example in your OpenAPI spec
* Override the Content-Type of a response

Overrides work in:

* **Mock mode** (with `--mock-backend`)
* **Catch mode** (with `--catch=true`)

---

## Supported Headers

| Header                           | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inspectr-response-status`       | Override the HTTP status code (e.g. `404`, `503`)       |
| `inspectr-response-delay`        | Delay response in milliseconds (e.g. `2000` = 2s delay) |
| `inspectr-response-example`      | Return a specific OpenAPI example by name               |
| `inspectr-response-content-type` | Override the `Content-Type` header in the response      |

<Aside>
These headers only affect how Inspectr generates or returns a response. They don’t change the request forwarded to the backend.

## Example: Simulate Downtime

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items \
  -H "inspectr-response-status: 503" \
  -H "inspectr-response-delay: 3000"
```

This simulates a 3-second server outage with a `503 Service Unavailable` status.

---

## Example: Return a Named OpenAPI Example

Your OpenAPI spec includes this:

```yaml
examples:
  validList:
    summary: A list of valid items
    value:
      items: ["A", "B", "C"]
  emptyList:
    summary: An empty list
    value:
      items: []
```

Use this header to select `emptyList`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items \
  -H "inspectr-response-example: emptyList"
```

---

## Example: Override Status Code Only

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/submit \
  -H "inspectr-response-status: 404"
```

This returns a `404 Not Found` response regardless of the mock or catch behavior.

---

## Example: Change Content-Type

Force a different `Content-Type` in the response:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/echo \
  -H "inspectr-response-content-type: text/plain"
```

---

## Summary

Response overrides help you simulate different scenarios without changing your backend or OpenAPI file. They’re great for testing, mocking, and QA validation workflows.
