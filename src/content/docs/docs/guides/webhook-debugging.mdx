Webhooks are crucial for integrating third-party systems—but they can be hard to debug. Inspectr makes it easy to capture, inspect, and replay webhook events locally or remotely.

## Use Cases

You’re building an app that receives webhook callbacks (e.g. from Stripe, GitHub, or Zapier), and you want to:

* See exactly what payloads are sent
* Validate headers or auth tokens
* Debug retries and delivery issues

---

## Step 1: Start Inspectr in Catch Mode

If you don’t have a backend to forward to, use `--catch` mode to just capture and respond:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true
```

* Returns `200 OK` by default to all requests
* Captures and logs every request
* UI available at [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)

---

## Step 2: Expose It Publicly (for Remote Webhooks)

To allow third-party services to call your local Inspectr instance:

```bash
inspectr --catch=true --expose=true --channel=webhooks --channel-code=secret123
```

Your webhook endpoint becomes:

```
https://webhooks.in-spectr.dev
```

---

## Step 3: Trigger the Webhook

Configure your third-party service to send its webhook to your Inspectr public URL:

```
https://webhooks.in-spectr.dev/events
```

Once triggered, the request is:

* Logged in your terminal
* Available in the Inspectr App UI
* Automatically responded to with `200 OK`

---

## Step 4: Replay Webhook Events

Inside the Inspectr App, select any captured request and **Replay** it to:

* Test how your local backend handles it
* Re-trigger the same event without third-party involvement

---

## Best Practices

* Use `--catch` mode when testing webhooks without needing a backend
* Secure your exposed channel using `--channel-code`
* Use Inspectr’s **Replay** feature for iterative development and debugging
* For handling certain types of events, use [Mocking APIs](/docs/features/mocking/)
