[//]: # '# Access Authentication'

Sometimes your backend or mock API doesn't include authentication, especially when you expose the service, so you want to restrict who can access it. Inspectr can introduce a guard, a simple auth layer to secure any service it proxies.

---

## Why Use Inspectr Authentication

- Shield mock or catch endpoints from unwanted traffic
- Secure exposed, public access to your service without adding code
- Provide temporary auth when the backend lacks it

---

## How It Works

Start Inspectr with authentication enabled and a secret:

```bash
inspectr --auth-enabled=true --auth-secret=mysecret
```

Inspectr prints two **API key** headers in the terminal:

```
inspectr-auth-key: mysecret
inspectr-auth-token: <jwt>
```

Send **one** of these headers with each request.

| Header                | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inspectr-auth-key`   | Plain secret for quick local testing                       |
| `inspectr-auth-token` | JWT signed with the secret; expires per `--auth-token-ttl` |

Both headers act as API keysâ€”include either one with every request.

Requests lacking a valid key or token get `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## Token TTL

Customize token lifetime (default `24h`) when starting Inspectr:

```bash
inspectr --auth-enabled=true --auth-secret=mysecret --auth-token-ttl=2
```

A fresh token is generated every run and expires after the TTL.

---

## Example Usage

### Using the encrypted Key

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api \
  -H "inspectr-auth-key: <key>"
```

### Using the JWT Token

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api \
  -H "inspectr-auth-token: <jwt>"
```

Tokens and keys appear each time Inspectr starts. Use this feature whenever you need lightweight protection without modifying your backend.

- **When to use the key:** handy for local development and CI where the secret needs to be private but can be reused without limits.
- **When to use the token:** safer for public or shared channels because it expires per the TTL. Restart Inspectr to rotate the token.

## Configuration

Enable the guard with CLI flags:

```bash
inspectr --auth-enabled=true --auth-secret=mysecret --auth-token-ttl=1h
```

Or in `.inspectr.yaml`:

```yaml
authEnabled: true
authSecret: mysecret
authTokenTtl: 1
```
