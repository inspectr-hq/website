[//]: # (# Exposing Services Publicly with Inspectr Ingress)

Sometimes you need your local service to be accessible from the outside world â€” for testing webhooks, collaborating on demos, or integrating with external systems.
Inspectr makes this easy with **Expose Mode**, providing a lightweight, secure **local tunnel** similar to tools like **ngrok** or **localtunnel**, but integrated directly with your API inspection flow.

---

## What Is Inspectr Ingress?

<FlowIngress client:only="react" />

Inspectr Ingress is a **secure tunneling relay**, exposing your local API service through Inspectr proxy to the public internet via a temporary subdomain on `in-spectr.dev`.

Example:

```
https://my-api.in-spectr.dev â†’ http://localhost:8080
```

This works just like creating an **HTTP tunnel**, where Inspectr safely forwards external requests to your local machine; without manual port forwarding or complex setup.

---

## Use Cases

* Testing third-party webhooks (Stripe, GitHub, Zapierâ€¦)
* Sharing live demos without deployment
* Allowing remote teammates to test your local service
* Connecting an LLM ([ChatGPT](/docs/examples/expose-mcp-server/), CoPilot, [Claude](/docs/examples/expose-mcp-server/)) to a local MCP Server
* Forwarding traffic to local AI models (e.g. [Ollama](/docs/examples/expose-ollama/))
* Acting as a secure **tunnel** for developers working with local APIs

## Step 1: Run Inspectr with `--expose`

```bash
inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000 --expose --channel=my-api --channel-code=secret123
```

* `--channel` sets your subdomain (e.g., `my-api.in-spectr.dev`)
* The `channel` is optional. If not set, a random channel is assigned
* The terminal will display the public URL after launch

---

## Step 2: Send Remote Requests

Use the public URL to test integrations, receive webhooks, or collaborate:

```bash
curl https://my-api.in-spectr.dev/api/hello
```

* Requests are forwarded to your local backend
* All traffic is logged in the terminal and UI
* Works seamlessly with webhooks, HTTP clients, or external services

---

## Public URL's Lifetime

* The public URL exists only while your Inspectr session is active
* Once Inspectr stops, the public subdomain is released
* No data is persisted on Inspectr ingress; it only forwards the traffic.
* You can use channels with a channel code to temporary reserve your public URL's.

[//]: # (* Use `--channel-code` to secure sensitive testing endpoints)
[//]: # (* Combine with `--catch` or `--mock-backend` if no backend exists)
