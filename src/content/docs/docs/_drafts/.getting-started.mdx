Inspectr makes it easy to monitor and debug HTTP traffic with zero-configuration CLI usage. This guide walks you through the installation and first run experience using different methods.

## Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need:

- Node.js installed for the `npx` or `npm` commands.
- A backend service running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Quick start


      ### Run Immediately with `npx`

      No installation required:

      ```bash
      npx @inspectr/inspectr --backend=http://localhost:3000
      ```

      Open [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004) to access the UI, and begin sending requests:

      ```bash
      curl http://localhost:8080/
      ```
