Having trouble getting Inspectr running? This guide covers the most common issues and how to resolve them.

---

## Port Conflicts

**Problem:**

You see an error like:

```
Inspectr Proxy service error: listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use
```

**Solution:**

Another process is using the port. You can:

* Kill the conflicting process

or

* Change Inspectr‚Äôs listen port:

```bash
inspectr --listen=:8888 --backend=http://localhost:3000
```

## Backend is unavailable

When the configured backend is not available or the request cannot be delivered, Inspectr will return a `502` HTTP status with a response:

```json
{
  "error": "Inspectr backend unavailable. Unable to connect to the backend service. Please ensure the service is running.",
  "code": 502
}
```

In the Inspectr, you will see a request with the status `N/A`

## No Requests Showing in the UI

**Problem:**

Inspectr starts, but no requests appear in the App.

**Checklist:**

* Are you sending requests **through** Inspectr (e.g., `localhost:8080`)?
* Is the request path correct?
* Are you forwarding to the right backend?
* Try adding `--print=true` to see terminal output.

---

## Replay Not Working

**Problem:**

You click ‚ÄúReplay‚Äù in the UI, but your backend doesn‚Äôt receive the request.

**Solution:**

* Make sure Inspectr is running with `--backend` set
* If you switched ports, ensure the replay is targeting the correct backend
* Check if your backend is running and reachable

---

## Mock Mode Returning Empty Responses

**Problem:**

Requests return `200 OK` but no body when using `--mock-backend`.

**Solution:**

* Ensure your OpenAPI spec includes examples under the correct media type
* For dynamic generation, use `--mock-dynamic=true`

---

## UI Not Loading

**Problem:**

App UI at `http://localhost:4004` is not responding.

**Solution:**

* Add `--app=true --app-port=4004` if the app was disabled
* Confirm the port is not blocked or already in use

## Tips for Smooth Debugging

* Always check the CLI output when something doesn‚Äôt work
* Confirm your Inspectr config with `--print` and `--log-level`
* Restart Inspectr if switching modes (mock/catch/backend)
