  Export and import captured operations using a JSON format.
</Aside>

When debugging APIs or webhooks, context is everything, but that context is often **temporary and short-lived**.

- Requests disappear once they are processed
- Debugging happens across machines, teams, or time zones
- Reproducing issues requires replaying entire request histories
- Sharing “what actually happened” is harder than sharing logs or screenshots

Inspectr allows you to **export all captured operations** — requests, responses, metadata, and context into a structured **JSON file**.

That file can then be:
- Stored outside Inspectr
- Shared with teammates
- Imported into another Inspectr instance
- Reviewed for debugging or investigations

This turns Inspectr into more than a live debugger; it becomes a **portable traffic archive**.

If you want to automate exports (for example, export on shutdown), jump to [Automation: CLI & YAML](#automation-cli-yaml).

## Exporting Operations

You can export operations at any time from the **Request History** view.

<Image src={importExportButtons} alt="Export/Import/Record Traffic" />

In the top navigation bar, you can find the buttons: **Export**, **Import** and the **Recording** toggle.

To export operations, click the **Export** button, which opens a modal.

<Image src={exportPresetModal} alt="Export Operations modal" width="500px" />

### Time Range Options

Inspectr supports two export modes:

#### Preset Range

<Image src={exportModal} alt="Export Operations modal - Presets" width="500px" />

Export everything captured since:
- Last hour
- Last 24 hours
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Since start Inspectr
- Since first operation

This is ideal for **quick exports** based on logical time periods.

#### Custom Range
Define an explicit **start and end time** to export only the relevant slice of traffic.

<Image src={exportCustom} alt="Export Operations modal - custom range" width="500px" />

This is ideal when:
- Investigating a specific incident
- Exporting traffic from a test run
- Sharing only the minimal reproduction set

---

### Export Format

The export format **JSON**, is a portable, Inspectr-native structure containing:
- Request & response data
- Headers and payloads
- Timing & metadata
- Correlation context

The exported file is fully compatible with Inspectr’s import feature.

---

## Importing Operations

Exported files can be loaded into **any Inspectr instance**.

<Image src={importOps} alt="Import operations modal" width="500px" />

Once imported:
- All operations appear in **Request History**
- Tracing, filtering, and inspection behave exactly the same
- No live traffic or backend is required

This makes Inspectr a powerful **review and analysis tool**, not just a proxy.

---

## Record Mode

Export becomes even more powerful when combined with **Record Mode**.

<Image src={exportRecordMode} alt="Record mode enabled" />

### What Is Record Mode?

Record Mode allows you to:
- Explicitly **start capturing** incoming traffic
- Clearly define when recording begins and ends
- Export only what was recorded during that session

<Image src={exportRecording} alt="Export recording summary" width="500px" />

This is especially useful when:
- Running automated test suites
- Capturing webhook deliveries
- Debugging transient production issues
- Collecting traffic for later analysis or sharing

Think of it as a **session recorder for API traffic**.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Enable **Record Mode**
2. Trigger webhooks or API calls
3. Stop recording once the scenario completes
4. Export recorded operations as JSON
5. Import them into another Inspectr instance
6. Inspect, trace, and analyze — without touching the original system

---

## Typical Use Cases

- **Sharing Issues with Teammates**
Export the exact traffic that caused a bug and let others inspect it locally — no backend access required.
- **Test & QA Reviews**
Capture requests during a test run, export them, and review behavior offline or in CI/CD workflows.
- **Archiving & Auditing**
Store request histories outside Inspectr for compliance, audits, or long-term reference.
- **Cross-Environment Debugging**
Capture traffic locally, import it on another machine, or replay analysis without re-triggering systems.
- **Documentation**
Use real request data when documenting APIs or explaining flows to new team members.

---

## Automated exports

For automated workflows, you can export operations on shutdown using the CLI or `.inspectr.yaml`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Export on exit via CLI">
    ```bash
    inspectr --export
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Export when running via YAML">
    ```yaml
    export: true
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is powered by Inspectr’s **export-on-exit** option, which writes a timestamped **JSON export** containing the operations captured during the run. It’s a simple way to turn “what happened” into a portable artifact you can archive, share, or attach to a ticket.

For full details (including export folder and filename format), see: **[Export Operations on Shutdown →](/docs/features/inspectr-export/)**

### Automated exports use-cases

- **CI / test runs as artifacts**
Capture traffic during an end-to-end run and publish the exported JSON as a build artifact.
- **Repro packs for bugs & analysis**
Export the exact requests/responses that triggered a problem and import them into another Inspectr instance for review.
- **Short-lived sessions with a trail**
Keep staging smoke tests, nightly checks or load-test sessions without running Inspectr permanently.

## Summary

Inspectr’s Export & Import feature lets you:
- Capture real traffic
- Preserve full context
- Share and replay API behavior anywhere
