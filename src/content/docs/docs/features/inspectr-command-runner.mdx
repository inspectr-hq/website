  Inspectr can trigger a command, script, ... on start up.
</Aside>


Inspectr can start a local command when it boots, run it in the background, and capture the output in a log file. This is handy when you want your API or Webhook Backend Service and Inspectr Proxy to be started together.

---

## Use Cases

- Launch a local dev server alongside Inspectr
- Start a backend service together with Inspectr
- Trigger setup scripts in one command for teammates

---

## Example

Start Inspectr and run a local dev server:

```bash
inspectr --command=npm --command-arg=run --command-arg=dev
```

Inspectr logs command output to `.inspectr/.inspectr-command-process.log` by default and stops the command when Inspectr exits.

You can also configure this in `.inspectr.yaml`:

```yaml
# Command
command: node
commandArgs:
  - demo.js
```
