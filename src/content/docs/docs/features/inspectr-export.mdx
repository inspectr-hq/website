  Inspectr Export lets you save and re-import sessions as JSON for sharing and review.
</Aside>


Inspectr can export the operations it captured into a timestamped JSON file when it shuts down. This is useful for sharing a session, archiving a CI/CD run, or replaying data later.

---

## Use Cases

- Share a proxy session with teammates or support
- Archive a test run for later analysis
- Store captured traffic as a build artifact in CI

---

## Example

Export operations on exit:

```bash
inspectr --export
```

Exported files are written to the `exports` directory by default. You can change the target directory using `exportDir` in `.inspectr.yaml`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Configure Export">
```yaml
export: true
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Configure Export with custom export folder">
```yaml
export: true
exportDir: archive/sessions
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Import an Export in the UI

After exporting, open the Inspectr UI.

<Image src={actions} alt="Inspectr Import/Export actions" />

Click on the import option in the top navigation, to load the JSON file from your `exports` folder.

<Image src={importOps} alt="Inspectr Import" width="500px" />

This lets you review the captured operations in the UI as a separate session.

---

## Export File Format

Example:

```
📦 Exported operations: exports/inspectr_operations_2026-01-04-142843_inst_1757169902.json
```

The filename is built as:

```
inspectr_operations_<timestamp>_<instance_id>.json
```

For the example above:

- `inspectr_operations` is a fixed prefix
- `2026-01-04-142843` is the export time in UTC (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`)
- `inst_1757169902293373000` is a stable instance id for that machine (stored in the local metrics DB so it stays consistent across runs)

So it's a timestamped export tagged with the machine's instance id.
