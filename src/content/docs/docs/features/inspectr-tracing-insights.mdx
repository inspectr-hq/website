  Use Inspectr’s new **Tracing** view to understand the full flow of your API interactions.
</Aside>

The **Tracing & Insights** view reveals how requests are connected across sessions, tools, or backends.
Each trace groups related requests by their **correlation ID** and **trace ID**, letting you see the full conversation timeline in one place.

Inspectr automatically correlates events as they flow through your local proxy, remote ingress, and backends — showing when, where, and how each call occurred.

## Tracing feature


### Trace Timeline
Inspectr displays every related request in a **nested timeline**:
- Visualize the order and duration of each request
- See parent-child spans for chained or recursive calls
- Review total trace duration and time between events

This makes it easy to understand how an incoming webhook triggered a downstream API, or how multiple tools interacted in a workflow.

### Correlation Context
Each trace includes the following identifiers:
- **Operation ID** — the captured OpenAPI operation
- **Correlation ID** — the shared ID linking related requests
- **Trace ID** — the unique identifier for each timeline
- **Trace Source** — where the event originated (e.g. proxy, ingress, MCP client)

Use these fields to pinpoint where a problem starts or to track flow consistency across environments.

### Metadata & Payloads
Inspectr keeps context close to the data:
- **Metadata** sections show proxy origin, client instance, and URL
- **Response Body** provides a direct view of the payload exchanged
- All contextual information is available side-by-side — no need to jump between logs

### Duration & Latency
Each request node includes precise timing information:
- Request start time
- Duration in milliseconds
- Aggregated total span time

Combined, they help you spot bottlenecks, repeated retries, or slow upstream dependencies.

### Tags & Filters
Attach and filter traces using tags such as:
- `mcp`
- `performance:fast`
- `proxy`

Tags make it simple to isolate behavior related to a specific tool, environment, or rule set.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Debugging Webhook Chains** — Understand what happens after your app receives a webhook.
- **Inspecting Local-to-Remote Flows** — Follow traffic from your local Inspectr proxy to a remote ingress.
- **Performance Profiling** — Identify which step in a multi-call sequence adds latency.
- **Validation Testing** — Confirm that automation rules triggered expected downstream calls.

## Example

<Image src={tracingDetails} alt="Tracing Overview" />

In the example above:
- The trace **`mcp-session-42`** shows two `POST /api/mcp/tools` requests
- Both complete successfully (`200 OK`) with durations of `44 ms` and `9 ms`
- Metadata reveals the proxy instance (`localhost:8080`) and full call path
- Response body displays the echoed payload for quick debugging

## Why It Matters

APIs rarely operate in isolation.
A single trigger often cascades into multiple requests — through integrations, middleware, or AI agent calls.

Inspectr’s tracing insights give you **end-to-end visibility** into those conversations.
You can follow the full path, measure each span, and confidently explain what happened and why.
