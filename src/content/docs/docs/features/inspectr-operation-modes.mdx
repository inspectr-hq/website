Inspectr can operate in four simple modes depending on what you’re trying to do:

- **Backend** – forward traffic to a real backend
- **Catch** – accept and capture requests without forwarding
- **Mock** – respond using OpenAPI-based mock responses
- **Mirror** – instantly echo requests back to the caller

Each mode solves a different problem, but all of them give you the same thing: **full visibility into real HTTP traffic without reconstructing behavior from logs**.

This guide explains each mode with:
- a minimal `.inspectr.yaml`
- a runnable `curl` example
- an example HTTP response
- what you’ll see inside Inspectr

---

## How Inspectr decides what to do

When a request arrives, Inspectr chooses a response strategy based on your configuration:

- If a **backend** is configured, requests are forwarded
- If **mockBackend** is configured, Inspectr generates a response from OpenAPI
- If **mirror** is enabled, Inspectr echoes the request back immediately
- If **catch** is enabled (or no backend is configured), Inspectr returns `200 OK`

You can always keep the UI enabled (`app: true`) to inspect traffic in real time.

## Backend mode

Backend mode is the default Inspectr workflow when you need full visibility into a real API.

<FlowLocalDebug client:only="react" />

Inspectr sits transparently between your client and backend:
1. The client sends requests to Inspectr
2. Inspectr forwards them to your backend
3. The backend response is returned unchanged
4. Inspectr captures the full exchange for inspection

### When to use backend mode

Use backend mode when you want to:
- debug real backend behavior without changing client code
- inspect headers, payloads, status codes, and errors
- analyze latency and response timing
- observe production-like traffic locally or in CI
- troubleshoot issues that only show up at runtime

Backend mode is ideal when your backend already exists and you need visibility, not simulation.

### Config

```yaml
# .inspectr.yaml
backend: "http://localhost:3000"

# Other options as example
app: true
appPort: "4004"
print: true
```

### Example request
```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello
```

### Example response (from backend)
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"message":"hello from backend"}
```

### What you’ll see in Inspectr

- Captured operation: GET /hello
- Full request & response (headers + body)
- Status code and timing information

---

## Catch mode

<FlowIngressWebhook client:only="react" />

Catch mode accepts requests and captures them — without forwarding them anywhere.

Inspectr always responds with a default 200 OK, making it safe to expose as a temporary or exploratory endpoint.

### When to use catch mode

Catch mode is ideal when you:
- need an instant webhook endpoint
- want to inspect payloads from third-party systems
- are exploring an undocumented or evolving integration
- don’t want to block senders with failures
- need a safe place to capture traffic before building logic

Catch mode is about receiving first, deciding later.

### Config
```yaml
# .inspectr.yaml
catch: true

# Other options ...
```

### Example request
```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhook \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"type":"ping","id":"evt_123"}'
```

### Example response
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
```

### What you’ll see in Inspectr

- Captured operation: POST /webhook
- Full payload for inspection and replay
- A clean baseline for overrides (status codes, delays, failures)

---

## Mock mode

<FlowLocalMock client:only="react" />

Mock mode lets Inspectr respond without a backend, using an OpenAPI document as the source of truth.

Responses can be static examples from your spec or dynamically generated based on schemas.

### When to use mock mode

Use mock mode when:
- the backend doesn’t exist yet
- you’re developing frontend or client code first
- you want deterministic responses for testing
- you’re validating client behavior against an API contract
- you want to test error cases without backend changes

Mock mode is ideal for contract-first development and fast iteration.

### Config (static mocking)

```yaml
# .inspectr.yaml
mockBackend: "./openapi.yaml"

# Other options...
```

### Example OpenAPI snippet

```yaml
# openapi.yaml
paths:
  /items:
    get:
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Success
          content:
            application/json:
              examples:
                default:
                  value:
                    items: ["A", "B", "C"]
```

### Example request
```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/items
```

### Example response (static)
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"items":["A","B","C"]}
```

### Config (dynamic mocking)

```yaml
# .inspectr.yaml
mockBackend: "./openapi.yaml"
mockDynamic: true
```

### Example response (dynamic)

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"items":["KqTzL","p9aV2","mR1xQ"]}
```

### What you’ll see in Inspectr

- Operation matched to OpenAPI path & method
- Generated response (static or dynamic)
- A clear link between spec and runtime behavior

## Mirror mode

Mirror mode turns Inspectr into a request reflection endpoint.

Every incoming request is captured and immediately echoed back as the response — no backend involved.

### When to use mirror mode

Mirror mode is perfect when you want to:
- see exactly what a client or webhook sender is transmitting
- debug headers, encoding, auth, and payload shape
- verify SDK or client behavior
- test connectivity from third-party systems
- remove backend behavior from the equation entirely

Unlike simple request mirrors, Inspectr also stores, replays, and exports every request.

### Config
```yaml
# .inspectr.yaml
mirror: true

# Other options...
```

### Example request
```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhook/test \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-source: stripe" \
  -d '{
    "event": "payment.succeeded",
    "id": "evt_123",
    "amount": 4200
  }'
```

### Example response (mirrored)
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
"event": "payment.succeeded",
"id": "evt_123",
"amount": 4200
}
```

### What you’ll see in Inspectr

- Captured operation: POST /webhook/test
- Request headers and payload
- Immediate feedback loop for client debugging
