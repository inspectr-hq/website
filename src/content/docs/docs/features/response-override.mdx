Inspectr supports special headers that let you override the response behavior for a request. This is helpful when you're testing edge cases, simulating failures, or customizing mock data on the fly.

This guide covers how to use response override headers and what they do.

---

##  When to Use Overrides

* Simulate network latency
* Force specific HTTP status codes (e.g. 404, 500)
* Choose a specific example in your OpenAPI spec
* Override the Content-Type of a response

Overrides work in:

* **Mock mode** (with `--mock-backend`)
* **Catch mode** (with `--catch=true`)

---

## Supported Headers

| Header                           | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inspectr-response-status`       | Override the HTTP status code (e.g. `404`, `503`)       |
| `inspectr-response-delay`        | Delay response in milliseconds (e.g. `2000` = 2s delay) |
| `inspectr-response-example`      | Return a specific OpenAPI example by name               |
| `inspectr-response-content-type` | Override the `Content-Type` header in the response      |
| `inspectr-tag`                   | Tag a request with one or more values (e.g. `billing`, `user:123`) |

<Aside>
These headers only affect how Inspectr generates or returns a response. They don’t change the request forwarded to the backend.

## Example: Simulate Downtime

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items \
  -H "inspectr-response-status: 503" \
  -H "inspectr-response-delay: 3000"
```

This simulates a 3-second server outage with a `503 Service Unavailable` status.

---

## Example: Return a Named OpenAPI Example

Your OpenAPI spec includes this:

```yaml
examples:
  validList:
    summary: A list of valid items
    value:
      items: ["A", "B", "C"]
  emptyList:
    summary: An empty list
    value:
      items: []
```

Use this header to select `emptyList`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items \
  -H "inspectr-response-example: emptyList"
```

---

## Example: Override Status Code Only

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/submit \
  -H "inspectr-response-status: 404"
```

This returns a `404 Not Found` response regardless of the mock or catch behavior.

---

## Example: Change Content-Type

Force a different `Content-Type` in the response:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/echo \
  -H "inspectr-response-content-type: text/plain"
```

---

## Example: Tag a Request

Apply simple or key/value tags that downstream tooling can read:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items \
  -H "inspectr-tag: billing, user:123"
```

You can send multiple `inspectr-tag` headers to attach several tags to the same request, or use the `key:value` pattern for structured tagging.

### When to tag requests

As you collect responses or webhooks, tags give you lightweight metadata that can help you bundle and mark operations, giving them additional context.
These tags can be used for filtering in the history and for statistic insights.

Some use-cases:
* **QA test runs** – Mark exploratory sessions (e.g. `inspectr-tag: qa:test-run-42`) so logs and analytics are easy to filter when triaging bugs.
* **Environment targeting** – Compare request data and how the API services behave differently (e.g. `inspectr-tag: env:staging`) between dev/staging/prod environments.
* **Version tracking** – Capture which app or API version triggered the request (e.g. `inspectr-tag: client-version:2.3.1`) when validating compatibility.

The `inspectr-tag" is never forwarded to the connected service, so your requests stay untouched. It is a powerful option to use for observability use-cases, comparing statistics on the dashboard or reviewing the request history with the extra context.

## Summary

Response overrides help you simulate different scenarios without changing your backend or OpenAPI file. They’re great for testing, mocking, and QA validation workflows.
